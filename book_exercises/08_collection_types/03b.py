"""
2 differences between lists and tuples:

• Lists are mutable // Tuples are immutable
• List uses [] surrounding a comma-delimited list of values // Tuple use ()


2 similarities:

• You can access objects in a list or tuple with the [] indexing syntax
• Both are ordered sequences that may contain any objects, or no objects and just
    be an empty list or tuple.
